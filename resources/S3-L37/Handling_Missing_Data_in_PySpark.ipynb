    "# Handling Missing Data in PySpark\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, most datasets you work with will be incomplete, which means you will have missing data. You have 2 basic options for filling in missing data (you will personally have to make the decision for what is the right approach):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drop the missing data points (including the possbily the entire row)\n",
    "2. Fill them in with some other value (like the average).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two different types of missing data to be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. null values represents \"no value\" or \"nothing\", it's not even an empty string or zero. It can be used to represent that nothing useful exists. \n",
    "2. NaN stands for \"Not a Number\", it's usually the result of a mathematical operation that doesn't make sense, e.g. 0.0/0.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's cover examples of each of these methods!"
